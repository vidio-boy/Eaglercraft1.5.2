<h1>IMPORTANT!</h1>

<p>
When you create a new world, it will be a black screen, or you may have spawned underground. <b>ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS WAIT 1–5 MINUTES!</b> It will fix on its own. It will also be laggy at first, but it will smooth out after 5–10 minutes. <b>Keep in mind that this is an old version of Minecraft and that not everything in the real current Minecraft will be avialable.</b>
